# Traffic-control-using-real-time-density-estimation
Developed a real-time AI-based traffic control system that dynamically changes signal timing based on estimated vehicle density. Utilized YOLOv8 for detection, OpenCV for video processing, ViT for classification, and PyTorch for deep learning, with threading for concurrent control.
